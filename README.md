# LiveWires Electronics Repo

Welcome to the LiveWires electronics repo. Eventually hopefully all the project information will be on here. For now it's just the new projects since this has been created.

Worksheets can be downloaded by going to the Actions page on GitHub, finding a relevant build (often the latest) and downloading the artefacts from the build.

If no build has been performed in the last 90 days, you will need to manually trigger a new build. Go to the actions page, click on the action on the left hand side titled "Build LaTeX Documents" and then click the "Run Workflow" button

## Macro Pad

This is the LiveWires Macro Pad, an 8-key macro pad based on a Raspberry Pi Pico and cherry switches. It has up to 16 configurable pages of keys, and runs CircuitPython.
