\section{PCB}
\begin{instructions}
	\instruction{
		Read through \textit{all} these instructions thoroughly.
	}
	\instruction{
		Make the PCB (using the clear film artwork like in section
		\ref{sec:etch}.) with the help of a team member.  Be careful
		to clean up the edges of the board before exposing it. Ensure
		the artwork is the right way up on the light box.
	}
	\instruction{
		Drill \textbf{all} the holes with a 0.8mm drill bit.
	}
	\instruction{
		Looking carefully at the image in section \ref{sec:drillsizes},
		drill all the blue holes with a 1.5mm drill bit.
	}
	\instruction{
		Looking carefully at the image in section \ref{sec:drillsizes},
		drill all the red holes with a 1.75mm drill bit.
	}
	\instruction{
		Looking carefully at the image in section \ref{sec:drillsizes},
		drill all the purple holes with a 2.6mm drill bit.
	}
	\instruction{
		Looking carefully at the image in section \ref{sec:drillsizes},
		drill all the green holes with a 4mm drill bit.
	}
	\instruction{
		Ask a team member to check your PCB, then you can start
		soldering (section \ref{sec:soldering})
	}
\end{instructions}

\section{Soldering}
\label{sec:soldering}
\begin{instructions}
	\instruction{
		Check and identify all components. Attach these with masking
		tape to the sheet lablled "Parts List" (Section
		\ref{sec:partslist}).
	}
	\instruction{
		You are now going to solder the components to the board using
		the instructions below.  You will need to refer to Section
		\ref{sec:placement} to see where each component should go.
	}
	\instruction{
		Solder in the four \ohm{220} resistors, R1, R2, R3 and R4.
	}
	\instruction{
		Solder in the four \ohm{10k} resistors, R5, R6, R7 and R8.
	}
	\instruction{
		Solder in the two capacitors, C1 and C2, both 10nF.
	}
	\instruction{
		Insert the 4 transistors, Q1-4. \textbf{Do NOT} solder them yet,
		and be careful to insert them the right way round (see the
		picture in Section \ref{sec:placement}).
	}
	\instruction{
		Get a member of team to check the orientation of the
		transistors, then solder them in place.
	}
	\instruction{
		Insert the 4 LEDs, D1-4. \textbf{Do NOT} solder them yet, and be
		careful to insert them the right way round (see the picture in
		Section \ref{sec:placement}).
	}
	\instruction{
		Get a member of team to check the orientation of the
		LEDs, then solder them in place.
	}
	\instruction{
		Solder the 4-pin header in the holes for U2. The pins are close
		together, so be very careful not to bridge any pins when
		soldering.
	}
	\instruction{
		Ask a team member for the correct jig. Attach the two 20-pin
		headers to the jig and insert the headers into the board, then
		solder them in place. Again, be careful not to bridge any pins.
	}
	\instruction{
		Solder the switches SW1-9.
	}
	\instruction{
		Solder the rotary encoder SW10.
	}
	\instruction{
		Ask a member of team to check your soldering.
	}
\end{instructions}

\section{Final Assembly}
\begin{instructions}
	\instruction{
		Get a team member to check all your work.
	}
	\instruction{
		With a team member, insert the screen and the Pi Pico and attach
		a micro-USB cable to check that your project works correctly.
	}
	\instruction{
		Once it all works (and not before!), fit the key caps to the
		switches and the knob to the rotary encoder
	}
	\instruction{
		Fit four rubber feet to the four corners of the bottom of the
		PCB, and a fifth rubber foot directly underneath the rotary
		encoder.
	}
\end{instructions}
